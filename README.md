- **Monitoring**: The CDN includes monitoring features to track CDN performance, analyze traffic patterns.
- **MongoDB**: Dexo CDN supports MongoDB as the underlying database to store metadata related to the cached assets, providing flexibility and scalability.
- **Node.js Compatibility**: The CDN is built specifically for use with Node.js, allowing developers to seamlessly integrate it into their Node.js projects.
